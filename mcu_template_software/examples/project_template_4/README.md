# Example Project 4

This example includes the ability to setup WiFi over bluetooth. It also includes a webserver (microdot)
that allows applications to be upgraded over the WiFi interface.


The message log from mpy_tool_gui (SERIAL PORT tab) when starting the app when it's connected to a WiFi network.
When connected to a WiFi network an incrementing count is printed.

```
MPY: soft reboot

If you open a web browser and connect to http://<MCU IP ADDRESS>:80
you should receive. The numbers presented are dummy and will change
with each page reload. 

You can update the html file in the assets folder 
to present the web page that you wish. Other files (css, javascript etc) 
can be added to the assets folder if required. The _updateContent()
method in the WebServer class (lib/webserver.py) updates the values on the 
web page/s after they are read from flash memory and before they are served 
to the clients web browser.

## Supported mpy_tool_gui functionality.

- The INSTALL tab can be used to load code onto an MCU.
- The WiFi tab can be used to setup the WiFi interface via USB or bluetooth connections.
- OTA (OVER THE AIR) tab UPGRADE and RESET WIFI CONFIGURATION buttons.
- SERIAL PORT tab can be used to view and send data on the serial port.
- MEMORY MONITOR tab can be used to monitor RAM and disk usage.

If you wish to add code for your project you should update the ThisMachine class app_task() method in the app1/app.py. This method is shown below.

```
class ThisMachine(BaseMachine):
...
    async def app_task(self):
        """@brief Add your project code here. 
                  Make sure await asyncio.sleep(1) is called frequently to ensure other tasks get CPU time."""
        count = 0
        while True:
            print(f"app_task(): count = {count}")
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
            count += 1
```

You may want to modify the above code for your projects functionality to read some values from sensors. These values can be used to update values in a dictionary.
The setParamDict() method on the WebServer class (lib/webserver.py) should be used to pass a reference to this dictionary which is 
then used by the WebServer class to update the values on the webpage served to the client.


## Details of WiFi setup functionality

The example code includes the allocation of two GPIO pins on the MCU, one connected to an LED and one connected to a button. 

See [WIFI_SETUP_GPIOS.md](WIFI_SETUP_GPIOS.md) for details of this.
